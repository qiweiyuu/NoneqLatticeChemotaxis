# Gillespie simulation for the nonequilibrium lattice model of the chemosensory array

This repository contains the code for the Gillespie simulation of the nonequilibrium lattice model of the chemosensory array. The model is described in the paper "Time-reversal symmetry breaking in the chemosensory array reveals mechanisms for asymmetric switching and dissipation-enhanced cooperative sensing" by David Hathcock, Qiwei Yu, and Yuhai Tu, which is available on the arXiv at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17424](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17424).


The code requires standard python libraries, including numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, as well as [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
